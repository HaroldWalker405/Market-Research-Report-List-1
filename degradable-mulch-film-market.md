<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degradable Mulch Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starch-based</li><li>Starch Blend with PLA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The degradable mulch film market consists primarily of two types: starch-based and starch blend with PLA (polylactic acid). Starch-based films are derived from natural starch, providing effective biodegradability and support for sustainable agriculture. In contrast, starch blend with PLA combines starch with a biopolymer, enhancing film durability and moisture retention while retaining biodegradability. Both types aim to reduce plastic waste in farming, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional plastic mulch, while promoting soil health and reducing chemical usage.</p></p>
