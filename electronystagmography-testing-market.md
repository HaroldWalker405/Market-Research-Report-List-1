<p><h1>Electronystagmography Testing Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2024 to 2031)</h1></p><p><strong>Electronystagmography Testing Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Electronystagmography (ENG) testing is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate vestibular and ocular functions by measuring involuntary eye movements. It is primarily utilized to diagnose balance disorders, vertigo, and other conditions related to the inner ear and brain. By using electrodes placed around the eyes, ENG captures and records eye movements in response to various stimuli, providing crucial insights into the patient's vestibular function.</p><p>The Electronystagmography Testing Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.00% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of vestibular disorders, an aging population, and advancements in technology leading to more accurate and efficient diagnostic procedures. The integration of ENG with other testing modalities, such as videonystagmography (VNG), enhances its application and accuracy. Furthermore, the rise in awareness about balance-related health issues and expanding healthcare infrastructure in emerging markets are propelling this market forward. Trends indicate a growing focus on remote and home-based testing solutions, driven by improvements in telemedicine and technology, which are reshaping the landscape of diagnostic procedures in audiology and neurology.</p></p>
