<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone densitometer market primarily features two types: DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and ultrasound. DEXA is the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density, utilizing two energy levels of X-rays to assess bone health, often used for osteoporosis diagnosis. Conversely, ultrasound bone densitometry offers a radiation-free, portable alternative, using sound waves to evaluate bone density, particularly in peripheral sites. Both methods cater to diverse clinical needs, enhancing osteoporosis management and overall bone health assessment.</p></p>
