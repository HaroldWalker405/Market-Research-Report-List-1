<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators market comprises two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve direct airway access, typically through an endotracheal tube, providing precise control over the volume of air delivered to the neonate's lungs. In contrast, non-invasive ventilators utilize masks or nasal interfaces, minimizing discomfort and reducing the risk of infection while still delivering adequate respiratory support. Both types aim to enhance the respiratory function of neonates with varying needs and conditions, ensuring effective care.</p></p>
