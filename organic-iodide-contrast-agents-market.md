<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Iodide Contrast Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li><li>Nonionic Dimers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organic iodide contrast agents market is categorized into three main types: ion type, non-ionic type, and non-ionic dimers. Ion type agents are water-soluble and contain ionized iodine, typically causing more side effects due to higher viscosity. Non-ionic type agents are less viscous, reducing the risk of adverse reactions, making them more widely used in imaging procedures. Non-ionic dimers consist of two iodinated structures, enhancing their safety and efficacy in medical imaging by further minimizing toxicity and improving contrast quality.</p></p>
