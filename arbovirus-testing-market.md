<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arbovirus Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibody Tests</li><li>Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arbovirus testing market comprises two main types: antibody tests and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Antibody tests detect the immune response to arboviruses, providing insights into past infections. These tests are typically used for serological surveys and epidemiological studies. In contrast, NAATs directly identify viral genetic material, allowing for the precise detection of active infections. NAATs offer quick results and higher sensitivity, making them essential for outbreak response and targeted treatment decisions in arbovirus cases.</p></p>
